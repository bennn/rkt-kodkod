\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:future}

In order of importance:
\begin{itemize}
\item Connect to a third-party SAT solver
\item Implement translations for the relational operators and first-order quanitifiers
\item Benchmark large examples against Kodkod and Rosette+Z3 (sudoku solver, etc)
\item Build more a programming language for the front-end (currently need to write out large specifications ``by hand'')
\item Add symmetry detection and skolemization
\item Add minimal core extraction
\item Integrate the finished solver with Rosette
\item Use any relevant technology to improve Rosette (i.e., a better way to call external programs than with Unix pipes)
\end{itemize}
